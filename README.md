This is a boilerplate project for creating react web applications. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Typescript

The project is built is Typescript which enables JavaScript developers to use highly-productive development tools and practices like static checking and code refactoring when developing JavaScript applications.

## Eslint and Prettier

Eslint and Prettier are used for code quality checks and code formatting. The configuration used for eslint is AirBnB.

### With VSCode

Make sure you perform the following steps in VSCode

1. Install the [ESLint package](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
2. Install the [Prettier package](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
3. Now we need to setup some VS Code settings via `Code/File` → `Preferences` → `Settings`. It's easier to enter these settings while editing the `settings.json` file, so click the `{}` icon in the top right corner:

```js
// IMP: This will make the fomatter run on save
"editor.formatOnSave": true,
// tell the ESLint plugin to run on save
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
  "source.fixAll": true
},
// Optional BUT IMPORTANT: If you have the prettier extension enabled for other languages like CSS and HTML, turn it off for JS since we are doing it through Eslint already
"prettier.disableLanguages": ["javascript", "javascriptreact","typescript","typescriptreact"],
```

## Husky and Lint staged

Husky is used for accessing git hooks. The `precommit` hook is used to initiate lint staged commands. You can look at the commands being run in the file `.lintstagedrc`.

## UI

The user interface is handled by [React Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)

## Routing

Url routing in the app is managed via [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
